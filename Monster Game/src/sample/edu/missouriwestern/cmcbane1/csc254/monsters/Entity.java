/**
 * Entity is intended to be an abstract class, although it is not in its current form
 * <p>
 * The following recommendations are for all entities:
 * - strength:  values should be 0.00 through 9.99
 * any value over 2.0 is likely to be an instant kill.
 * 1.0 would be a full strength human with a sword.
 * Something like a plant would have a strength of 0.0
 * A bunny might have a strength of .05 unless it is a Monty Python bunny
 * A T-Rex might have a strength of 5.5
 * - aggressiveness:  Must be between 0 and 1.0
 * 1.0 would mean attacks at every opportunity.
 * 0.7 would attack 70% of the time and not attack 30%
 * 0 would be for something like a plant.
 * - health:  Health also represents stamina
 * Value should be > 0.0 through 1.00
 * Anything below .10 is considered unconscious
 * 0 is dead.
 * 1.0 is full health (100%)
 * <p>
 * Symbols are taken from unicode or just txt.
 * For an alien you could use ðŸ‘½
 * A good source is https://emojipedia.org
 * Using emoji will mess up printing because they are not standard width.
 * - stamina:   Stamina  is greater than 0.
 * Stamina is roughly approximated by size.  A good start is
 * 1 KG = .01 point of stamina
 * .80 would be about 180 pound human.
 * 1. would be about a 250 pound human (maybe a warrior)
